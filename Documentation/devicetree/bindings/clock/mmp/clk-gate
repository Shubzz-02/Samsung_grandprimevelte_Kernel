Binding for Marvell MMP series gate clock and common gate clock

There two type of gate clock used by Marvell MMP series SOC.
The common gate clock and the gate clock defined for MMP series SOC.

For common gate clock

Required properties
- compatible : It should be "marvell,mmp-clk-general-gate";
- clock : The parent of the clock.
- marvell,mmp-clk-bit-gate : The offset of the bit control the gate.

Examples
apmu_clocks: apmu_clocks {
	compatible = "marvell,mmp-clk-master";
	reg = <0xd4282800 0x1000>;
	pll1_416_gate: pll1_416_gate {
		compatible = "marvell,mmp-clk-general-gate";
		clocks = <&pll1_416m>;
		marvell,reg-offset = <0 0x40>;
		marvell,mmp-clk-bit-gate = <27>;
	};
};

For MMP series gate clock

Required properties
- compatible : It should be "marvell,mmp-clk-gate";
- clock : The parent of the clock.
- marvell,mmp-clk-mask : The (mask, val_enable, val_disable) for the clock.

Examples
apmu_clocks: apmu_clocks {
	compatible = "marvell,mmp-clk-master";
	reg = <0xd4282800 0x1000>;
	usb_clock: usb_clock {
		compatible = "marvell,mmp-clk-gate";
		marvell,reg-offset = <0 0x5c>;
		marvell,mmp-clk-mask = <0x9 0x9 0x1>;
	};
};
