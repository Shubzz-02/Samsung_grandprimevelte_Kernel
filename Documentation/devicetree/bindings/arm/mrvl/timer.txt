* Marvell MMP Timer controller

Each timer have multiple counters, so the timer DT need include counter's
description.

1. Timer

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "marvell,mmp-timer".
- reg : Address and length of the register set of timer controller.
- marvell,timer-fastclk-frequency : The fast clock frequency of the timer.
  Timer will have several clock inputs: fast clock, 32KHZ, 1KHZ. For all
  SOCes use this timer controller, fast clock may not be same.
- marvell,timer-apb-frequency : The fequency of the apb bus that the timer
  attached to. This frequency and "marvell,timer-fastclk-frequency" are used
  to calculated delay loops for clock operations.

Optional properties:
- marvell,timer-has-crsr : This timer has CRSR register.
- marvell,timer-has-shadow : This timer has shadow register.

2. Counter

Required properties:
- compatible : It can be
      "marvell,timer-counter-clkevt" : The counter is used for clock event
                                       device.
      "marvell,timer-counter-clksrc" : The counter is used for clock source.
      "marvell,timer-counter-delay" : The counter is used for delay timer.
- marvell,timer-counter-id : The counter index in this timer.

Optional properties:
- interrupts : The interrupt for clock event device.
  Only valid for "marvell,timer-counter-clkevt".
- marvell,timer-counter-cpu : which CPU the counter is bound. Only valid for
  "marvell,timer-counter-clkevt".
- marvell,timer-counter-broadcast : When this counter acts as clock event
  device. It is broadcast clock event device.
  Only valid for "marvell,timer-counter-clkevt".
- marvell,timer-counter-nodynirq : When this counter acts as broadcast clock
  event device, it cannot switch the IRQ of broadcast clock event to any CPU.
  Only valid for "marvell,timer-counter-clkevt".

3. Examples

timer0: timer@d4014000 {
	compatible = "marvell,mmp-timer";
	reg = <0xd4014000 0xc8>;
	marvell,timer-fastclk-frequency = <3250000>;
	marvell,timer-apb-frequency = <26000000>;
	status = "okay";

	counter0 {
		compatible = "marvell,timer-counter-clkevt";
		interrupts = <13>;
		marvell,timer-counter-id = <0>;
		marvell,timer-counter-cpu = <0>;
		marvell,timer-counter-frequency = <32768>;
	};

	counter1 {
		compatible = "marvell,timer-counter-clksrc";
		marvell,timer-counter-id = <1>;
		marvell,timer-counter-frequency = <32768>;
	};
};
