Binding for Marvell MMP series master clock.

The MMP related device tree support for clock based on the clock type not clock
controller. So specific SOC, user need define the DT file for the clock such as
pxa910-clock.dtsi.

Almost all types of clock will need parameter as "register", and it will map the
"register" before access it. If every clock map the "register" seperately, there
will be a lot of waste.

A master clock is defined for this kind of situation. It will be responsible for
map the registers for all clocks that lists as its children in DT file.

Required properties
- compatible : It should be "marvell,mmp-clk-master".


Optional properties:
- reg : The register start and range the master clock covered.

Optional properties for child node:
- marvell,reg-offset : It is a two-values item - <register_index regiser_offset>.
                   Master node will map the registers for all its children. So
                   for the child it need to pass the information about register
                   index and offset. "register_index" indicates which register space
                   it from because master clock can have mutiple register space in
                   "reg". "register_offset" indicates the offset in the register
                   space.

Examples
There are two clocks, clk1 has register at 0xd4210010, and clk2 has register at
0xd42100c0.

apmu_clk {
	compatible = "marvell,mmp-clk-master";
	reg = <0xd4210000 0x1000>;

	clk1 {
		...
		marvell,reg-offset = <0 0x10>;
	};

	clk2 {
		...
		marvell,reg-offset = <0 0xc0>;
	};
};
