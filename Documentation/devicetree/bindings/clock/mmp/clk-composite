Binding for Marvell MMP series composite clock

The common clock defines a general composite clock with div/mux/gate.
Because MMP series has clock need combines the div/mux together, so
there is a new type of clock "mix". The "mix" clock can also be
composited with gate clock. In fact, many mix clocks and gate clocks
share same registers.

In the device tree file, the clock to be composited should be child
of the composite clock.

Required properties
- compatible : It should be "marvell,mmp-clk-composite" for (mix, gate)
               composition, or "marvell,mmp-clk-general-composite" for
               (mux, div, gate) composition.


Examples
1. There are three clocks mux1, div1, gate1.

apmu_clk {
	compatible = "marvell,mmp-clk-master";
	reg = <0xde210000 0x1000>;

	general_composite_clk {
		compatible = "marvell,mmp-clk-general-composite";

		mux1 {
			...
		};
		div1 {
			...
		};
		gate1 {
			...
		};
	};
};

2. There are two clocks mix1, gate2

apmu_clk {
	compatible = "marvell,mmp-clk-master";
	reg = <0xde210000 0x1000>;

	composite_clk {
		compatible = "marvell,mmp-clk-composite";

		mix1 {
			...
		};
		gate2 {
			...
		};
	};
};
