Device tree bindings for Marvell VPU devfreq device

Required properties:

 - compatible:          Should be "marvell,devfreq-vpu" for VPU devfreq.
 - "marvell,vpu-id"	The id of VPU devfreq device. It supports 2 devices at
			max now, one for decoder and another for decoder.
 - clocks:              The id of VPU function clock and bus clock in device tree
 - clock-names:		The name of VPU function clock and bus clock, which
			should be "vpu-fclk","vpu-bclk".

Optional properties:
 - "marvell,mmp-clk-freq-combine"	The relationship of function clock and
					bus clock. If there is no table, the
					bus clock is fixed when function clock
					changes.
 - "marvell,qos"			Indicate the device supports min/max
					qos feature.

Example:

	devfreq-vpu {
		compatible = "marvell,devfreq-vpu";
		marvell,vpu-id = <0>;
		clocks = <&soc_clocks PXA1U88_CLK_VPU
			  &soc_clocks PXA1U88_CLK_VPUBUS>;
		clock-names = "vpu-fclk", "vpu-bclk";
		marvell,mmp-clk-freq-combine =
				<156000 156000>,
				<208000 208000>,
				<312000 312000>,
				<416000 416000>,
				<528750 528500>;
		marvell,qos;
	};
