lm3532_bl bindings

Required properties:
  - compatible: "ti,lm3532"
  - reg: I2C slave address (u8)
  - avdd-supply: regulator that supplies the device.

Optional properties:
  - flags: various flags for the device:
	# LM3532_CONFIG_MAP_ALL_CTRL_A- all ILEDS will be controlled by Control
	  A PWM and Control A registers.
	# LM3532_CONFIG_ALS- enables device working with IRQ, registering
	  as input device.
  - ramp_time: desired ramp time in microseconds. the larger the ramp time the
    smoother is the transition to a new brightness level.
  - ctrl_a_fs_current: configures the full-scale current setting for the
    current sink assigned to Control Bank A.
  - ctrl_a_mapping_mode: chooses the mapping type as either exponential or
    linear.
  - ctrl_a_pwm: configures control A PWM register.
  - rst_gpio: gpio that resets the device.
  - feedback_en_val: configures which current sinks are part of the boost
    control loop.
  - output_cfg_val: configures how the three control banks are routed to the
    current sinks (ILED1, ILED2, ILED3).

Example:
	backlight1: lm3532@38 {
		compatible = "ti,lm3532";
		reg = <0x38>;
		flags = <0>;
		ramp_time = <0>;
		ctrl_a_fs_current = <0x13>; /* 20.2mA */
		ctrl_a_current_ctrl = <0x1> /* use I2C control */
		ctrl_a_mapping_mode = <0x2>; /* use linear mapping */
		ctrl_a_pwm = <0x86>;	/*
					 * CTRL_A zone 0 PWM enable,
					 * polarity active high
					 */
		rst_gpio = <&gpio 32 0>; /* reset GPIO is 32 */
		avdd-supply = <&ldo9>; /* regulator is ldo9 */
		feedback_en_val = <0x1> /* ILED1 feedback enable */
		output_cfg_val = <0x0>	/*
					 * ILEDX (X = 1, 2, 3) controlled by
					 * Control A PWM and Control A
					 * Brightness.
					 */
	};
