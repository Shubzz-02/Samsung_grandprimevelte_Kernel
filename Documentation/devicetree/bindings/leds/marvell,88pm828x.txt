LEDs connected to 88pm828x

Required properties:
- compatible : should be : "marvell,88pm828x".
- reg: the slave address of 88pm828x as one twsi device, it should be 0x10.
- ramp_mode: IDAC current ramp up/down mode, typically 0x2 (Non-Linear Mode).
- idac_current: IDAC current setting, typically 0xa00 (20mA by default).
- ramp_clk: ramping clock for Linear or Non-Linear mode, typically 0x0 (8KHz).
- str_config: WLED String Configuration, 1 for 88PM828; 0 for 88PM828A.

Optional properties:
- avdd-supply: power domain for twsi bus. it's platform dependent.

Examples:

backlight: pm828x@10 {
	compatible = "marvell,88pm828x";
	reg = <0x10>;
	ramp_mode = <0x2>;
	idac_current = <0xa00>;
	ramp_clk = <0>;
	str_config = <0x1>;
	avdd-supply = <&ldo12>;
};
