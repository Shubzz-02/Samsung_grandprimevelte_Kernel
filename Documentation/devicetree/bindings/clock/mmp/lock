Binding of spin lock support for Marvell MMP series clock

Because some clocks share same register, spinlock need to be used to avoid
conflicts.

The spin lock sharing detection is based on regsiter address, and it is
automatically. To support some clocks, the spin lock is not based on
register address, some properies are provided.
The properites are used as part of clock's properties in clock device tree
files.

Optional properties:
marvell,mmp-clk-spinlock-new : Skip the automatic detection based on
			       register address. Direclty create a new
			       spin lock.
marvell,mmp-clk-spinlock : It is handle. It points to the clock that share
			   same spin lock.

Examples:

Assume that clk1, clk2, clk3 share same spin lock.

apmu_clk {
	compatible = "marvell,mmp-clk-master";
	...

	clk1 {
		...
		marvell,mmp-clk-spinlock-new;
		...
	};

	clk2 {
		...
		mmp-clk-spinlock = <&clk1>;
		...
	};

	clk3 {
		...
		mmp-clk-spinlock = <&clk1>;
		...
	};
};
