* MARVELL PXA-ION Implementation

** Required properties:

- compatible: should be "marvell,pxa-ion"

- marvell,ion-nr: indicates number of ion heaps we are going to create,
		   should equal to the number of child heap nodes.

** Optional properties

- marvell,ion-iommu: indicates if we are going to attach ion devices
		     to iommu mapping domains.
- heap1: 	     the child node of heap we are going to create,
		     include below properties:

** heap required properties:

- marvell,ion-name: name of the heap;

- marvell,ion-type: indicates the type of heap_data to be created,
		    like ION_HEAP_TYPE_SYSTEM etc.

- marvell,ion-id:   the id for this heap, user can use this id to
		    specify allocate buffer from which heap

** heap optional properties:

- marvell,ion-base:  indicates the start address of the heap

- marvell,ion-size:  indicates the size of this heap


Example:

ion {
	compatible = "marvell,pxa-ion";
	marvell,ion-nr = <2>;
	status = "okay";
	marvell,ion-iommu = <1>;
	heap1 {
		marvell,ion-name = "carveout_heap";
		marvell,ion-type = <2>;
		marvell,ion-id = <2>;
		marvell,ion-base = <0>;
		marvell,ion-size = <0>;
	};
	heap2 {
		marvell,ion-name = "system_heap";
		marvell,ion-type = <0>;
		marvell,ion-id = <0>;
	};
};
