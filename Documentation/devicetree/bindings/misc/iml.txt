* IML driver.

The DMA addr provided by CP is not physical address so we may need to manually revert it to phy addr again or DMA operation will fail.
The phy addr -> CP side address remapping rule is based on CP address remapping register, which defines how many bits in CP address are replaced
with content in the remapping register.
Note that DMA engine hardware on some platforms can support non phy addr provided by CP, in which case remap register is not needed.

Required properties:
- compatible: "marvell,mmp-iml"
- reg: the share memory address, RIPC lock address, RIPC clock address, CP address remapping register (optional)
- interrupts: the RIPC interrupt
- interrupt-names: name of the interrupt
- (optional) remap: <remap bit starting pos in CP addr remap register, remap bit starting pos in CP address, number of bits to remap>
- dmas: dma channel for rx
- dma-names: dma name

Examples:

iml: iml@7ffffe0{
	compatible = "marvell,mmp-iml";
	reg = <0x07ffffe0 0x10>, <0xd403d200 0x10>, <0xd403b038 0x10>, <0xd4282d24 0x4>;
	interrupts = <0 56 0x4>;
	interrupt-names = "IPC_MSA_DATA";
	remap = <0 26 6>;
	dmas = <&pdma0 0xFF 0>;
	dma-names =  "iml-dma";
	status = "disabled";
};
