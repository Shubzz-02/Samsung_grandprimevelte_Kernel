LEDs connected to lm3532

Required properties:
- compatible : should be : "marvell,lm3532".
- reg: the slave address of lm3532 as one twsi device, it should be 0x38.
- flags: to select
	LM3532_CONFIG_BUTTON_BL/LM3532_CONFIG_ALS/LM3532_DISP_BTN_TIED/LM3532_HAS_WEBTOP.
- ramp_time: startup/shutdon ramp rate, typically 0x0 (8Âµs/step).
- ctrl_a_fs_current: full-scale current setting of control A, typically 0x13
(20.2mA by default).
- ctrl_a_mapping_mode: LED Current mapping mode of control A, typically 0x2 (linear mapping).
- ctrl_a_pwm: to select which PWM input (PWM1 or PWM2) is mapped to Control
Bank A and which zones the selected PWM input is active in, typically 0x86.
- rst_gpio: reset control for lm3532, it's platform dependent.

Optional properties:
- avdd-supply: power domain for twsi bus. it's platform dependent.

Examples:

backlight: lm3532@38 {
	compatible = "marvell,lm3532";
	reg = <0x38>;
	flags = <0>;
	ramp_time = <0>;
	ctrl_a_fs_current = <0x1b>;
	ctrl_a_mapping_mode = <0x2>;
	ctrl_a_pwm = <0x86>;
	rst_gpio = <&gpio GPIO(6) 0>;
	avdd-supply = <&ldo12>;
};
